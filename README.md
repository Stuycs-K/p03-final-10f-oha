### OH!

Adam Oh

### Project Description:

A simple, terminal based test editor. You will be able to select the file you open, open the file, make your edits, and then save and close the file. If you don't save, it will save the file as it was before. When quitting, it will bring you to a confirmation page to double check that you want to quit.

### Instructions:

Install ncurses: 
    type in the following commands into your terminal:
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

Enter "make run" into the terminal

It will display a list of files in your current directory, type in the file you want to edit (find it works best with txt files).

It will display the contents of the file. Make your edits and use ctrl + s to save your work.

When you are done, use ctrl + \ to quit and type y to confirm you quit.
